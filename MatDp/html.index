                    <h4>Math + Brazil + Archery</h4>
                    <p>My name is Luis Resende I'm a student in 11th grade at High Tech HIgh in San Diego, liberty Station, CA. I spent most of my life back in Brazil in south America, and I moved here to the US with 13 years old, before coming here I didn't know how to speak english at all, I just had to learn by talking to people. When I'm off the school I love to play some video specially ghost recon right now.</p>

                   <h1>Project</h1>
                   <h4>Organization</h4>
                   <p>We worked with the San Diego food bank organization. The thing that stood out the most was how many people they help each month, they help around 370.000 people, that was a really amazing thing for me, since I had never heard of this organization so I thought they would be a smaler, but they turned out to be the biggest organization in San Diego. Really cool thing that I learned was that when they recieve a larger amount of help is usually from wealthier families, because they bring a bigger group every time they come, like their 3-6 children they have. </p>

                   <h4>Improvements</h4>
                   <p>During this math project I belive one of the things I was most proud of was in the very end when I actully started to make sense of it, I worked mostly in the math part of witch was really fun, and because of that I improved my skills on spread sheet a lot. I belive because I worked really hard with one of my group mates in the last two weeks before the due date we manage to create this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I-MQPxHtPPigBUIAvBTA4ApeORozoR10_OLrTKxDWFs/edit">wonderfull reaserch papper.</a></p>
